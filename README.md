🎮 Maze Race: Player vs Bot
Maze Race is a maze racing game where a human player competes against a smart AI bot. The goal is to reach the end point of the maze before the opponent. The maze is randomly generated and contains static obstacles that block certain paths.

In AI mode, the bot uses the A* pathfinding algorithm to calculate the shortest route to the goal and moves automatically based on those calculations. The human player navigates the maze manually using keyboard controls.

💡 Features
- Race between a human player and an AI bot in a randomly generated maze
- Smart AI bot that uses the A* algorithm for pathfinding
- Graphical interface built with Pygame
- Score tracking and multiple rounds

🧠 Used Technologies

Python / Pygame / A* Pathfinding Algorithm

🕹️ Game Mode

Player vs Bot

📌 Project Goal

The goal is to build a simple yet interactive game that combines AI pathfinding and real-time competition, offering a fun and educational implementation of the A* algorithm in a visual environment.
